You can install gulp locally on your machine or you can just go fork the "public" folder. The only thing is, you may have to unminify the code.

## Gulp Setup

If you have node, you'll be fine

Install Gulp using `npm install -g gulp`. This installs Gulp globally and is needed later.

Clone this repo to your local computer using this command:

    git clone git@github.com:cssanimation/gulp-sass-starter.git starter

With the files downloaded, navigate to your `starter` folder on the command line (or Terminal) and run `npm install` to set things up.

If that doesn't work, it may be necessary to use `sudo npm install`.

With this set up, you should now be able to run:

    gulp

This will process any Sass (SCSS) files and launch a web browser showing the current files. Making changes to the files should result in the page updating automatically.
